# ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Use These Files!

You're using the WRONG files. Here's what to do:

## ❌ DON'T Use These (OLD - BROKEN):
- `deploy_docker.sh` ❌
- `Dockerfile.production` ❌
- `docker-compose.production.yml` ❌

## ✅ DO Use These (NEW - WORKS):
- `deploy_simple.sh` ✅
- `Dockerfile.simple` ✅
- `docker-compose.simple.yml` ✅

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Fix

### On Your Server Right Now:

```bash
# Stop what's running
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove old .env if it exists
rm -f .env

# Run the CORRECT script
sudo bash deploy_simple.sh
```

---

## 📦 Or Upload Fresh Files

If `deploy_simple.sh` doesn't exist on your server:

### On Your Computer:

```bash
cd /app

# Upload ONLY these 3 files
scp -i your-key.pem deploy_simple.sh ubuntu@13.48.194.83:~/
scp -i your-key.pem Dockerfile.simple ubuntu@13.48.194.83:~/
scp -i your-key.pem docker-compose.simple.yml ubuntu@13.48.194.83:~/
```

### On Your Server:

```bash
sudo bash deploy_simple.sh
```

## 🎯 Why This Matters

**OLD Files (what you're using):**
```bash
Dockerfile.production → Tries to COPY local files → FAILS ❌
```

**NEW Files (what you should use):**
```bash
Dockerfile.simple → Gets everything from Git → WORKS ✅
```

---

## 🔍 How to Check Which You're Using

Look at the error message:
```
failed to solve: "/docker/.env.frontend.template": not found
```

This means you're using `Dockerfile.production` (OLD) ❌

The NEW `Dockerfile.simple` doesn't have these COPY commands! ✅

---

## ⚡ Quick Fix Command

```bash
# On your server, run this:
sudo bash deploy_simple.sh
```

That's it!
