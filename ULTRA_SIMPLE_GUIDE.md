## 🚀 Three Steps. That's It.

### Step 1: Get Ubuntu Server on AWS

1. Login to AWS
2. Click "Launch Instance"
3. Choose **Ubuntu 22.04**
4. Click Launch
5. Download your key file (save it!)
6. Copy your server IP

**⏱️ Time: 2 minutes**

---

### Step 2: Upload the Installer

**On your computer, open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows):**

```bash
scp -i YOUR-KEY-FILE.pem auto_deploy.sh ubuntu@YOUR-SERVER-IP:~/
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR-KEY-FILE.pem` → your actual key file name
- `YOUR-SERVER-IP` → your actual server IP

**Example:**
```bash
scp -i aws-key.pem auto_deploy.sh ubuntu@54.123.45.67:~/
```

**⏱️ Time: 30 seconds**

---

### Step 3: Run ONE Command

**Connect to your server:**

```bash
ssh -i YOUR-KEY-FILE.pem ubuntu@YOUR-SERVER-IP
```

**Run this:**

```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

**⏱️ Time: 5-10 minutes (automatic)**

---

## ❓ Questions the Installer Will Ask

### 1. GitHub Repository
```
What is your GitHub repository URL?
```
**Type:** `https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo`

---

### 2. Branch
```
Which branch should I deploy? (Default: main)
```

---

### 3. Domain
```
Do you have a domain name (like myapp.com)? (Y/N, Default: N)
```
**Type:** `N` then press Enter (unless you have a domain)

---

### 4. Database
```
Where would you like to host your MongoDB database?
  1) Self-hosted (I'll install MongoDB on this server)
  2) MongoDB Atlas (Cloud-hosted, you provide connection URL)
  
Choose option (1 or 2):
```
**Type:** `1` then press Enter (easiest option)

---

### 5. Database Name
```
What should I name your database? (Default: app_database)
```
**Just press Enter** (uses default name)

## 🔄 To Update Your App Later

**After you push changes to GitHub:**

```bash
ssh -i YOUR-KEY-FILE.pem ubuntu@YOUR-SERVER-IP
cd /opt/app
git pull
sudo supervisorctl restart all
```

**Or just run the installer again:**

```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

---

## 🆘 Something Wrong?

### Can't connect to server?

**Fix permissions on your key file:**
```bash
chmod 400 YOUR-KEY-FILE.pem
```

### Site not loading?

**Wait 1 minute, then try again.** Services need time to start.

Still not working?

**Restart everything:**
```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart all
```

### Installation failed?

**Just run it again:**
```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

The installer is smart and will fix issues automatically.
