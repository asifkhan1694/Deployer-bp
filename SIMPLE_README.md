# 🚀 One-Command Deployment - Super Simple!

Deploy your FastAPI + React application in **ONE COMMAND**. No coding knowledge required!

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (For Absolute Beginners)

### Step 1: Get an Ubuntu Server

1. Go to AWS and launch an Ubuntu 22.04 instance
2. Copy your server IP address
3. Download your SSH key file (`.pem` file)

### Step 2: Upload the Installer

**On your computer:**

```bash
# Replace with your details
scp -i your-key.pem auto_deploy.sh ubuntu@your-server-ip:~/
```

**Example:**
```bash
scp -i my-key.pem auto_deploy.sh ubuntu@54.123.45.67:~/
```

### Step 3: Run the ONE Command

**Connect to your server:**
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-server-ip
```

**Run the installer:**
```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

**That's it!** ✨

## 🎯 What Happens Next?

The installer will ask you a few simple questions:

### Question 1: GitHub Repository
```
❓ What is your GitHub repository URL?
   Your answer: https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo
```

### Question 2: Domain or IP
```
❓ Do you have a domain name (like myapp.com)? (Y/N, Default: N)
   Your answer: N
```
*(The installer automatically detects your IP)*

### Question 3: SSL Certificate (if you have a domain)
```
❓ Would you like me to set up free SSL (HTTPS) with Let's Encrypt? (Y/N)
   Your answer: Y
```

### Question 4: Database
```
Where would you like to host your MongoDB database?
  1) Self-hosted (I'll install MongoDB on this server)
  2) MongoDB Atlas (Cloud-hosted, you provide connection URL)
  
Choose option (1 or 2): 1
```

### Question 5: Database Name (if self-hosted)
```
❓ What should I name your database?
   (Default: app_database)
   Your answer: [press Enter]
```

**Then the installer does EVERYTHING automatically:**

✅ Installs Python 3.11  
✅ Installs Node.js 20  
✅ Installs MongoDB (if self-hosted)  
✅ Installs Nginx  
✅ Clones your code  
✅ Installs all dependencies  
✅ Configures everything  
✅ Sets up SSL (if requested)  
✅ Starts your application  

**Time: 5-10 minutes** ☕

## 🔄 How to Update Your App

Made changes to your code? Update is super easy:

### Method 1: Full Redeploy (Recommended)

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-server-ip
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

The installer is smart - it will detect existing installation and only update what changed.

### Method 2: Quick Update

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-server-ip
cd /opt/app
git pull
sudo supervisorctl restart all
```

---

## 🛠️ Simple Commands

### Check if Everything is Running

```bash
sudo supervisorctl status
```

You should see:
```
backend    RUNNING
frontend   RUNNING
```

### View Logs (if something's wrong)

```bash
# Backend logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log

# Frontend logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/supervisor/frontend.out.log
```

### Restart Your App

```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart all
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't connect to server

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure your key file has correct permissions
chmod 400 your-key.pem

# Use the correct username (ubuntu, not root)
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-server-ip
```

### Problem: Site not loading

**Solution 1:** Wait a minute (services need time to start)

**Solution 2:** Check services
```bash
sudo supervisorctl status
```

**Solution 3:** Restart everything
```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart all
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Problem: Error during installation

**Solution:** Run the installer again
```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```
The installer is smart and will fix any issues.

## 🔒 Security Notes

### After successful installation:

1. **Setup firewall (recommended):**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
sudo ufw enable
```

2. **If using self-hosted MongoDB, set up authentication:**
```bash
mongosh
```
```javascript
use admin
db.createUser({
  user: "admin",
  pwd: "your-strong-password",
  roles: ["root"]
})
```
