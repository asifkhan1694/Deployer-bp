# ⚡ QUICK FIX - Installer Freezing Issue

## 🚨 If The Installer Freezes

### Use the VERBOSE Version Instead!

The verbose version shows EVERYTHING happening in real-time - no hidden output!

```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy_verbose.sh
```

---

## 🎯 What's Different?

### Regular Version (`auto_deploy.sh`)
- Pretty progress bars
- Hidden output
- **May appear frozen** (but actually working)

### Verbose Version (`auto_deploy_verbose.sh`)  ✅
- Shows ALL output
- You see every package installing
- **Never appears frozen**
- You know exactly what's happening

---

## 🚀 How to Use Verbose Version

**Step 1: Stop the frozen installer**
```bash
Ctrl+C
```

**Step 2: Clear locks**
```bash
sudo killall apt apt-get
sudo rm -f /var/lib/dpkg/lock*
```

**Step 3: Run verbose installer**
```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy_verbose.sh
```

**Step 4: Answer questions**
```
GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo
Branch: main
Database: 1
Database name: [Press Enter]
```

**Step 5: Watch it install!**

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### If even verbose version hangs:

**Check your internet:**

ping -c 3 google.com
```

**Check available space:**
```bash
df -h /
# Should show at least 5GB free
```

**Check if another process is updating:**
```bash
ps aux | grep apt
# If you see apt running, wait for it to finish
```

**Try rebooting:**
```bash
sudo reboot
# Wait 2 minutes, then reconnect and try again
```
