## 🚀 THE COMPLETE GUIDE (3 Steps)

### STEP 1: Get Ubuntu Server (2 minutes)

1. **Go to AWS Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. **Click**: Launch Instance
3. **Select**: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
4. **Download**: Your key file (`.pem`)
5. **Copy**: Your server IP address

✅ **Done with Step 1!**

---

### STEP 2: Upload Installer (30 seconds)

**On your computer, open Terminal and type:**

```bash
scp -i YOUR-KEY.pem auto_deploy.sh ubuntu@YOUR-IP:~/
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR-KEY.pem` = your actual key file
- `YOUR-IP` = your actual server IP

**Example:**
```bash
scp -i aws-key.pem auto_deploy.sh ubuntu@54.123.45.67:~/
```

✅ **Done with Step 2!**

---

### STEP 3: Run ONE Command (10 minutes automated)

**Connect to your server:**

```bash
ssh -i YOUR-KEY.pem ubuntu@YOUR-IP
```

**Run the magic command:**

```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

**Answer 5 simple questions:**

1. **GitHub repository URL**: `https://github.com/your/repo`
2. **Branch**: Just press Enter (uses `main`)
3. **Have domain?**: Type `N` and press Enter
4. **Database choice**: Type `1` and press Enter (self-hosted)
5. **Database name**: Just press Enter (uses default)
6. **Confirm**: Type `Y` and press Enter

**That's it! The installer now does EVERYTHING:**

- ✅ Installs Python 3.11

## 🔄 How to Update Your App

**After pushing changes to GitHub:**

```bash
ssh -i YOUR-KEY.pem ubuntu@YOUR-IP
cd /opt/app
git pull
sudo supervisorctl restart all
```

**Or just run the installer again:**

```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Installer Freezes or Hangs

**Most common cause:** Package manager lock

**Quick fix:**

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop, then:
sudo killall apt apt-get
sudo rm -f /var/lib/dpkg/lock*
sudo dpkg --configure -a

# Run test first:
sudo bash test_installer.sh

# Then run installer again:
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

### Can't Connect to Server

```bash
chmod 400 YOUR-KEY.pem
ssh -i YOUR-KEY.pem ubuntu@YOUR-IP
```

### Site Not Loading

**Wait 1-2 minutes, then try again.**

Still not working?

```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart all
```

### Installation Error

**Just run it again:**

```bash
sudo bash auto_deploy.sh
```

The installer is smart - it fixes itself!
